  <p>Dependency</p>
  <p>We have been made dependant on our governments to give us a piece of paper (ownership or rental agreement) for us to be able to live in what we call our houses. This is not how it was before, we could build where ever we wanted and call it our home. Now, we have to work all day to be able to pay mortgage or rent and be able to live in our houses.</p>

  <p>Blindness</p>
