  <h1>What is going on in the world?</h1>
  <p>Dependency</p>
  <p>You have been made dependant on your government to give you a piece of paper (ownership or rental agreement) for you to be able to live in what you call your house. This is not how it was before but things changed and here you are. You have to work all day to be able to pay mortgage or rent and be able to live in your house.</p>
  <p>Attention</p>
  <p>Your attention has been robbed from you with television, movies and social media. Events that do not affect you in anyway have engaged you for the remaining of your time</p>
  <p>Control</p>
  <p>You have lost control on your life and you have lost control of yourself. After your full-time job and the distractions that keep you engaged for the remaining time, you hardly have time to realize that you have no control, let alone being able to do anything about it.</p>
  <p>Blindness</p>
  <p>Because of not being in control for all this time, you are now blind to what you have become.</p>
