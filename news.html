  <p>Dependency</p>
  <p>You have been made dependant on your government to give you a piece of paper (ownership or rental agreement) for you to be able to live in what you call your house. This is not how it was before but things changed and here you are. You have to work all day to be able to pay mortgage or rent and be able to live in your house.</p>
