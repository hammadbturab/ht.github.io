  <h1>Recently..</h1>
  <h2>In the last few hundred years, the following aspects of human lives have changed</h2>
  <h3>Dependency</h3>
  <p>We have been made dependant on our governments to give us a piece of paper (ownership or rental agreement) for us to be able to live in what we call our houses. This is not how it was before, we could build where ever we wanted and call it our home. Now, we have to work all day to be able to pay mortgage or rent and be able to live in our houses.</p>
  <h3>Attention</h3>
  <p>Our attention has been robbed from us with television, movies and social media. Fictional events that do not affect us in anyway have engaged us for the remaining of our time. Even the news we see is biased beyond easy comprehension.</p>
  <h3>Control</h3>
  <p>We have lost control of our lives and we have lost control of ourselves. After our full-time jobs and the distractions that keep us engaged for the remaining time, we hardly have time to realize that we have no control of our time, let alone being able to do anything about it.</p>
  <h3>Blindness</h3>
  <p>Because of not being in control for all this time, we are now blind to what we have become. We are controlled slaves.</p>
  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>So how do we get out of this slavery? We start thinking..</p>
